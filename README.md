## A mobile window quoting application for contractors, developed for The Window Specialist.

The Window Specialist is a revolutionary mobile application for the construction and window industry. Currently, the process of obtaining window quotes can be a struggle. Conversation between clients and contractors goes back and forth - clients detail specifications for their desired windows, and the contractors relay this information to the office for quote generation. Window specifications are input manually into window manufacturer software, and this oftentimes results in long wait times for clients.

Our application aims to streamline this process, by allowing the contractor to generate window quotes with clients on-site. Our software takes input from the client regarding information such as window width/height and window type/option, defaulting other options along the way. It then interfaces with a UiPath RPA to automate the manufacturer software mentioned above, from which a complete window quote in .pdf format is received, all within a matter of minutes.
